# Moodify
## Inspiration
Today, we are going toward a world where everyone is striving for achievement, but many people are succumbing to depression as a result of this struggle. Making a few poor decisions occasionally. As a result, Moodify was designed to assist people in de-stressing by recommending movies and songs based on their feelings.
## What it does
Moodify is an OpenCV-based facial expressions recognition model that, based on the user's mood, recommends a few movies and music selections using a machine learning algorithm, which may help individuals cheer up and save time when browsing for a suitable film or song.
## How we built it
Python is the primary programming language, and many of its libraries are utilised, including CV2, Keras, numpy, pandas, and others. The model uses a deep learning algorithm to recognise the user's facial expressions; the model is first trained and evaluated on a dataset of over 34,000 photos. The model first detects the user's expression and then suggests movies and music to cheer them up. Flask, HTML, and CSS are used to deploy the project to the web. With a user-friendly layout, our Web page strives to provide the user with a positive atmosphere.
