# Moodify
## Inspiration
Today, we are going toward a world where everyone is striving for achievement, but many people are succumbing to depression as a result of this struggle. Making a few poor decisions occasionally. As a result, Moodify was designed to assist people in de-stressing by recommending movies and songs based on their feelings.
## What it does
Moodify is an OpenCV-based facial expressions recognition model that, based on the user's mood, recommends a few movie and music selections using a machine learning algorithm, which may help individuals cheer up and save time when browsing for a suitable film or song.
